    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <p>
      Hello, I'm Manuel Chave and I'm passionate about technology currently studying Web and Computer Programming at BYU-I.
      I started my studies in 2022 and since then I try to practice every day and so today I understand technologies aimed at software development and design.
      
      From the moment I've been participating in groups and communities in which we create real, complex and responsive projects.
      
      I am looking for my first opportunity as a software developer and I am open to face-to-face work in Maputo, Mozambique and remotely around the world.
